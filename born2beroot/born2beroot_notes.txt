	Notes for Evaluation

	Debian vs Rocky?
		Debian is better suited for begginers;
		Debian is better documented;
		Rocky is usually used for compnaies due to the better security protocols;
	
	What is a VM?
		It's a virtual machine that used the physical components of your physical one.
		It's completely separated from your main machine having it's own OS and applications;
		It's a safe option for servers or for testing applications;

	Aptitude vs Apt?
		These are both packtager managers that allow you to install various commands and apllications in your machine;
		Apt is more lower-level and only do what you tell it to do;
		Aptitude can make suggestions on what packs to install and unistall unutilized ones;

	Password rules
		I used a library to control the quality of the password, making changes to 2 files:
		etc(/)login.defs to make the expiracion rules;
		etc(/)pam.d/common-password to the rest of the format rules;

	LVM
		Stands for logical volume manager and it takes care of the creating and manage of the various partitions;
		partition vs volume? partition is a division of memory, volume is the set of partitions the the OS uses for mass storage;
	
	UFW
		Stand for Uncomplicated firewall and takes care of the port changes without compormising security;

	SSH
		Incription for comunication bettewn a host and a client;
